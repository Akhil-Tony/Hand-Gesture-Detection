<ul>
  <li>
Using generating_data.py file you can generate your own training data .. that means there is no need for any data u should download from internet.So you can teach any 
gesture to your neural network
  </li>
  <li>
Usinig the training_model.py file you can train your model on the training data
  </li>
  <li>
And finally u can test the generated gesture_model.h5 model (which will be replaced everytime you execute the training_model.py ) using testing.py.
 </ul>
